                <p>
                    My name is Dakota Card and I am currently in college studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Georgian College in Barrie on pace to graduate in 2025 with an advanced diploma. Learning how computers work on the inside and learning how to manipulate them to do what you want has always been a interest of mine and learning new things about this field and industry is always fascinating. I am excited to learn more and grow within this industry, and to see what I can contribute.
